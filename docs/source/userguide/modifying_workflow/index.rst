How to recover an experiment
----------------------------

We utilize the recovery command to restart Autosubmit when it is killed in an ungraceful way. 

The recovery command will change the state of all the tasks that are (or can be) in READY status to COMPLETED if a completed file for that task is found. 

To recover a running workflow, we must issue the recovery command with -f, so Autosubmit kills the tasks in remote before resetting their status.

Because tasks might have completed in remote, we can ask Autosubmit to check for the completion file there. To do so, use the recovery command with the --all flag.

.. warning:: without the -s Autosubmit will only perform a dry-run (i.e. it will not take effect) of the command  

Before commiting to changes on the state, check the .txt file generated by Autosubmit with the states of the tasks. When we are satisfied with the results we can use the parameter -s, which will save the change to the pkl file and rename the update file.

Examples:

::

    # check for completion files of the current active jobs ( SUBMITTED, QUEUING, RUNNING )
    autosubmit recovery <EXPID>

    # check for completion files of all jobs
    autosubmit recovery <EXPID> --all

    # Save changes
    autosubmit recovery <EXPID> -s

    # If there are active jobs, kill them in remote.
    autosubmit recovery <EXPID> -f

    # If some platform is not reachable, force the recovery without checking remote
    autosubmit recovery <EXPID> --offline -f --all

    # check in remote for completion files
    autosubmit recovery <EXPID> --all -s

    # Resume the experiment:
    autosubmit create <EXPID> -np
    autosubmit recovery <EXPID> -all -s [--offline] [-f]
    autosubmit run <EXPID>

Options:

.. runcmd:: autosubmit recovery -h

How to rerun a part of the experiment
-------------------------------------

This procedure allows you to create automatically a new pickle with a list of jobs of the experiment to rerun.

Using the ``expdef_<EXPID>.yml`` the ``create`` command will generate the rerun if the variable RERUN is set to TRUE and a RERUN_JOBLIST is provided.

Additionally, you can have re-run only jobs that won't be include in the default job_list. In order to do that, you have to set RERUN_ONLY in the jobs conf of the corresponding job.

::

    autosubmit create <EXPID>

It will read the list of jobs specified in the RERUN_JOBLIST and will generate a new plot.

Example:
::

    vi <experiments_directory>/<EXPID>/conf/expdef_<EXPID>.yml

.. code-block:: yaml

    ...

    rerun:
        RERUN: TRUE
        RERUN_JOBLIST: RERUN_TEST_INI;SIM[19600101[C:3]],RERUN_TEST_INI_chunks[19600101[C:3]]
    ...

    vi <experiments_directory>/<EXPID>/conf/jobs_<EXPID>.yml

.. code-block:: yaml

    PREPROCVAR:
        FILE: templates/04_preproc_var.sh
        RUNNING: chunk
        PROCESSORS: 8

    RERUN_TEST_INI_chunks:
        FILE: templates/05b_sim.sh
        RUNNING: chunk
        RERUN_ONLY: true

    RERUN_TEST_INI:
        FILE: templates/05b_sim.sh
        RUNNING: once
        RERUN_ONLY: true

    SIM:
        DEPENDENCIES: RERUN_TEST_INI RERUN_TEST_INI_chunks PREPROCVAR SIM-1
        RUNNING: chunk
        PROCESSORS: 10

Run the command:

    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
